# Internal indicators
* Domains for intranet
* Internal hostname or keyword or something like that I can search on google and github, if google or github mentions that result , it is probably interesting.
     * For example in uber, uberinternal.com is all of their internal structures , so if i find a github repo or something mentioning uberinternal.com , either it belong to random person or some uber employee , so i should look at their repos as well and I have got tooling to help me with that as well.
